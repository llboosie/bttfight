This is BetterFight v1.0.

This script includes the following:

1) Custom Crosshair
2) Headshot disabler
3) Jump spam prevention
4) Custom and very customizable recoil.
5) Roll Prevention
6) View Cam Forcer while shooting.
7) Weapon Damages
8) Garbage collector for optimization.

This script has been optimized a lot, more updates will come soon.

As for the exports you may see them here:

1) exports['BetterFight']:AlterSpecificGunRecoil(`WEAPON_PISTOL`, 4.00) -- Alter a specific guns recoil. This is a multiplier, first value is the weapons hash and the second is the multiplier value.
2) exports['BetterFight']:AlterGeneralGunRecoil(0.5) -- Alter the general recoil system. Can get any value. This is a multiplier. So recoil now is recoil * 0.5.
3) exports['BetterFight']:ResetAllGunRecoil() -- Resets all guns recoils. This should be only used when you have used the 2 exports above and you want to reset all the data.
